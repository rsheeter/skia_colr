Skia is a complete 2D graphic library for drawing Text, Geometries, and Images.

See full details, and build instructions, at https://skia.org.

This repo is meant to house COLR test utils. To try on Mac or Linux:

  ./build_colr.sh
  ./out/Static/colr_test

This was originally based on the following work in progress branches but
is now based on upstream FreeType and Skia.
